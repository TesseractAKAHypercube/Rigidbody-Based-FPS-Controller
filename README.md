# Rigidbody-Based-FPS-Controller

The controller includes head bobbing. To use that (otherwise the controller won't work) you should create a __Camera Orientation__ game object, and then you put the __main camera__ under it.   __You shouldn't put the main camera into the "Camera" variable!__ 
Also, you should create a game object that should be at the bottom of the player model. This game object should be put in the "Legs" variable.
